# Battle Minigames
The fights in the game are carried out through minigames with each attack (Player and Enemies alike).

For the consideration of creating the most basic implementation we will create a base Minigame class in GDScript and create 3 minigames derived from it.
These will be:
- Skuldoo holding the attack button to smash an enemy with the hammer
- The cog attacks you, you will press the right button at the right time to duck and evade it.
- Press the right button when you jump and land on top of an enemy.
